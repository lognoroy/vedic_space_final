        <p>
        Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 on August 31,  it helps cleanse and reshape our aesthetic perception and ideals in the process. As it transitions between its phases of blazing brightly in the morning and evening sky, Venus is currently invisible and cannot be seen at dawn or night.
        Venus is urging us to turn inward and away from the pressures of the outside world, enabling the inner guidance we receive to inspire changes in the way we interact with others and communicate our aspirations.
        Venus undergoes a rebirth when it joins the sun during Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 because this solar union plants the light that will radiate in its upcoming cycle. Venus encounters two distinct kinds of conjunctions with the sun over the course of its whole cycle because it is halfway between the earth and the sun in its orbit.
        Since it is closest to the earth during its orbit, Venus’ inferior conjunction occurs while it is retrograde. On the other hand, the conjunction of Venus and the sun that is visible to us is referred to as the superior conjunction since Venus is direct and is doing so from the other side of the sun from the earth in its orbit.

        <h3>Venus conjunct Venus in Leo 2022- Significance</h3>
        <p>
            Venus is currently in its furthest phase from Earth during its cycle, symbolically indicating a greater need on our part to let go of past fixations. Venus will be at her most solar when Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 because the blazing Leo sun will ignite Venus’s heart.
            We could throw out outdated relationship habits into the fire started by Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022, much like a summer campfire. Take your time to investigate any underlying issues that have been keeping you from pursuing and enjoying pleasure.
            We can burn off the personal baggage that has been dragging us down, just as Venus gets burnt up by the sun. Although Venus in Leo is renowned for drawing attention with its glitz and star power, during its invisibility we will have the chance to reevaluate how we have been balancing our outward presentation and presentational style with our inner ideals.
            As a result, we can make use of Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 to let go of and purge any untruthful behaviors we may have been exhibiting. We will start to become more conscious of our inner capacity to creatively actualize in the world around us as we start to purge the unnecessary.
            Venus will be concealed from view until the end of September, when it will reappear as an evening star, after the Leo sun revives its light. Venus’ prolonged return from its underworld phase can help us accept and have compassion for whatever stage we are at in our creative endeavours or interpersonal relationships.
            Make room to nurture and heal old scars, as well as any thoughts of inadequacy or unworthiness that may surface if we do not get the desired amount of outside approval. Allow change to happen naturally rather than getting upset or attempting to force things to happen. Venus will ultimately be assisting us in bringing our innermost desires into physical manifestation.
            Sun conjunct Venus may be paradoxical. This is due to the fact that contemporary astrology overlooks the phenomenon of combustion and considers this feature to be incredibly favorable.   When Venus is closer than 8 degrees to the Sun, it is rendered invisible by its beams. It  is invisible in this situation, which causes mistrust.
            When Venus is able to shine, Sun conjunct Venus expresses positively. Therefore, the greater combination will make one courteous and well-liked as well as an excellent diplomat or counselor.
            No matter what happens, a settlement is reached during this time, but occasionally the façade that results from conflict avoidance might be somewhat deceptive. Sun conjunct Venus is fascinated by relationships of all kinds and is rather nosy about other people’s affairs.
            Due to their propensity for being incredibly attractive and endowed with an abundance of natural charm, people with the Sun conjunct Venus find it rather simple to maintain partnerships. People with the Sun conjunct Venus are typically quite kind and will conduct themselves with great dignity if the ascendant is involved.
            Every time Venus makes a transit, it moves from one zodiac to the next over a period of around 23 days. At 4:09 pm on Wednesday, August 31, 2022, the morning star Venus will change signs and enter the sign of Leo, the Sun’s adversary. Venus won’t set in Leo until September 15, 2022, when it will still be in this zodiac. In this situation, Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 will affect everyone’s life and result in substantial changes for the country.
