        Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 on August 31,  it helps cleanse and reshape our aesthetic perception and ideals in the process. As it transitions between its phases of blazing brightly in the morning and evening sky, Venus is currently invisible and cannot be seen at dawn or night.
        Venus is urging us to turn inward and away from the pressures of the outside world, enabling the inner guidance we receive to inspire changes in the way we interact with others and communicate our aspirations.
        Venus undergoes a rebirth when it joins the sun during Sun conjunct Venus in Leo 2022 because this solar union plants the light that will radiate in its upcoming cycle. Venus encounters two distinct kinds of conjunctions with the sun over the course of its whole cycle because it is halfway between the earth and the sun in its orbit.
        Since it is closest to the earth during its orbit, Venus’ inferior conjunction occurs while it is retrograde. On the other hand, the conjunction of Venus and the sun that is visible to us is referred to as the superior conjunction since Venus is direct and is doing so from the other side of the sun from the earth in its orbit.
